# Polarity Classification of Words

Words from large text files are cosidered and are scanned for their polarity in the given context using Map Reduce Logic. 
Map : Every mapped word is compared with a standard positive/negative word corpus. 
Reduce : Aggregated count grouped by polarity so that result is no.of.positive and no.of.negative words in the file.
